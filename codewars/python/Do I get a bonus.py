# Title: Do I get a bonus?
# Rank: 8 kyu
# Language Version: Python 3.4.3

## Instructions ##
# It's bonus time in the big city! The fatcats are rubbing their paws in anticipation... but who is going to make the most money?
# Build a function that takes in two arguments (salary, bonus). Salary will be an integer, and bonus a boolean.
# If bonus is true, the salary should be multiplied by 10. If bonus is false, the fatcat did not make enough money and must receive only his stated salary.
# Return the total figure the individual will receive as a string prefixed with "Â£" (= "\u00A3", JS and Java) or "$" (C#, C++, Ruby, Clojure, Elixir, PHP and Python, Haskell).
#
## Solution ##
def bonus_time(salary, bonus):
    return "$" + str(salary * 10) if bonus else "$" + str(salary)

## Test Case ##
Test.describe("Basic tests")
Test.assert_equals(bonus_time(10000, True), '$100000')
Test.assert_equals(bonus_time(25000, True), '$250000')
Test.assert_equals(bonus_time(10000, False), '$10000')
Test.assert_equals(bonus_time(60000, False), '$60000')
Test.assert_equals(bonus_time(2, True), '$20')
Test.assert_equals(bonus_time(78, False), '$78')
Test.assert_equals(bonus_time(67890, True), '$678900')
