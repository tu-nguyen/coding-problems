## Instructions ##
# Terminal game move function
# In this game, the hero moves from left to right. The player rolls the dice and moves the number of spaces indicated by the dice two times.
# Create a function for the terminal game that takes the current position of the hero and the roll (1-6) and return the new position.
# Example:
# move(3, 6) should equal 15
#
## Solution ##
def move(position, roll):
    return position + (roll * 2)

## Test Case ##
test.assert_equals(move(0, 4), 8)
test.assert_equals(move(3, 6), 15)
test.assert_equals(move(2, 5), 12)
